# 🚀 Code Similarity Detection and Clustering Tool by Team Orion

Welcome to the **Python Code Similarity Detection and Clustering Tool** developed by **ORION**. This tool utilizes a hybrid approach that combines AST-based and text-based methodologies with the K-Means algorithm to effectively detect code similarity in Python.

## 🌐 Live App
You can access the live application [**here**](https://thesis-roqzofhqframgkykcznpcp.streamlit.app/).

## 📖 Step-by-Step Guide

### Part 1: App - Code Similarity Detection and Clustering

1. **🔄 Upload Python Files**:
   - On the homepage, use the file uploader to upload your Python files or a ZIP archive containing Python files.

2. **⚙️ Process Uploaded Files**:
   - After uploading, the application will automatically process the files to calculate similarity metrics.

3. **📊 View Similarity Data**:
   - Once processing is complete, you will see a summary of the similarity metrics, including:
     - **Text Similarity**
     - **Structural Similarity**
     - **Weighted Similarity**

4. **📥 Download CSV File**:
   - After viewing the similarity data, click the download button to export the results as a CSV file.

### Part 2: Analyze - Clustered Code Similarity Analysis

1. **📤 Upload CSV File**:
   - Navigate to the **"Analyze"** section of the app.
   - Use the file uploader to upload the CSV file generated from the Code Similarity Detection and Clustering step.

2. **📜 View Uploaded Data**:
   - Once the CSV file is uploaded, you can view the complete DataFrame within an expander for a clean layout.

3. **📈 Summary Statistics**:
   - Expand the summary statistics section to view descriptive statistics of the dataset.

4. **🔍 Filter Data**:
   - Use the filter options in the sidebar to refine the data based on cluster selection and similarity score ranges.

5. **🔑 View Filtered Data**:
   - After applying filters, the filtered data will be displayed along with an explanation of color coding for similarity scores.

6. **📉 Visualize Similarity Metrics**:
   - Explore various visualizations, including scatter plots and histograms for a better understanding of the similarities.

7. **💾 Download Filtered Data**:
   - If needed, you can download the filtered data as a CSV file through the download button in the sidebar.
