        Detecting similarity between code submissions can be time-consuming and difficult. To address this problem, this tool offers an innovative method for detecting code similarity,
        focusing on both the structural representation and code text information of Python code provided by Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and a text-based approach. By leveraging these
        attributes, the method seeks to achieve a comprehensive detection of similarity in Python codes, capturing both structural patterns and textual features. Additionally, the computational
        efficiency of the K-Means algorithm will be utilized in clustering Python codes that exhibit similarity in their code text and structure, streamlining the process of identifying
        similarities and differences with in a set of code submissions.
